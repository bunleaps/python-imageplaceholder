# 🐍 python-imageplaceholder
For this python project I used python Pillow module to work with image modification. I created a python function that takes in `id, name, dob(date of birth), joined(joined date), address`. I found a card online that need those specification so I just go with it and learn Pillow on the way.

Module: [Pillow Python](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Basic of Pillow](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pillow-a-fork-of-pil/)
Photo Viewer: [Visum Photo Viewer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/visum-photo-viewer/9n1x3z50blm8)
Code Editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
